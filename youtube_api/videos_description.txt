Jeffries (James Stewart) is confined to his tiny, sweltering courtyard apartment. To pass the time between visits from his nurse (Thelma Ritter) and his fashion model girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), the binocular-wielding Jeffries stares through the rear window of his apartment at the goings-on in the other apartments around his courtyard. As he watches his neighbors, he assigns them such roles and character names as \"Miss Torso\" (Georgine Darcy), a professional dancer with a healthy social life or \"Miss Lonelyhearts\" (Judith Evelyn), a middle-aged woman who entertains nonexistent gentlemen callers. Of particular interest is seemingly mild-mannered travelling salesman Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), who is saddled with a nagging, invalid wife. One afternoon, Thorwald pulls down his window shade, and his wife's incessant bray comes to a sudden halt. Out of boredom, Jeffries casually concocts a scenario in which Thorwald has murdered his wife and disposed of the body in gruesome fashion. Trouble is, Jeffries' musings just might happen to be the truth. One of Alfred Hitchcock's very best efforts, Rear Window is a crackling suspense film that also ranks with Michael Powell's Peeping Tom (1960) as one of the movies' most trenchant dissections of voyeurism. As in most Hitchcock films, the protagonist is a seemingly ordinary man who gets himself in trouble for his secret desires.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Universal (1954)\nCast: Raymond Burr, James Stewart\nDirector: Alfred Hitchcock\nProducers: James C.

Jeffries (James Stewart) is confined to his tiny, sweltering courtyard apartment. To pass the time between visits from his nurse (Thelma Ritter) and his fashion model girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), the binocular-wielding Jeffries stares through the rear window of his apartment at the goings-on in the other apartments around his courtyard. As he watches his neighbors, he assigns them such roles and character names as \"Miss Torso\" (Georgine Darcy), a professional dancer with a healthy social life or \"Miss Lonelyhearts\" (Judith Evelyn), a middle-aged woman who entertains nonexistent gentlemen callers. Of particular interest is seemingly mild-mannered travelling salesman Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), who is saddled with a nagging, invalid wife. One afternoon, Thorwald pulls down his window shade, and his wife's incessant bray comes to a sudden halt. Out of boredom, Jeffries casually concocts a scenario in which Thorwald has murdered his wife and disposed of the body in gruesome fashion. Trouble is, Jeffries' musings just might happen to be the truth. One of Alfred Hitchcock's very best efforts, Rear Window is a crackling suspense film that also ranks with Michael Powell's Peeping Tom (1960) as one of the movies' most trenchant dissections of voyeurism. As in most Hitchcock films, the protagonist is a seemingly ordinary man who gets himself in trouble for his secret desires.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Universal (1954)\nCast: Raymond Burr, Wendell Corey, James Stewart, Grace Kelly\nDirector: Alfred Hitchcock\nProducers: James C.

Hayek ages some 30 years onscreen as she charts Frida Kahlo's life from feisty schoolgirl to Diego Rivera prot\u00e9g\u00e9e to world-renowned artist in her own right. Frida details Kahlo's affluent upbringing in Mexico City, and her nurturing relationship with her traditional mother (Patricia Reyes Spindola) and philosophical father (Roger Rees). Having already suffered the crippling effects of polio, Kahlo sustains further injuries when a city bus accident nearly ends her life. But in her bed-ridden state, the young artist produces dozens upon dozens of pieces; when she recovers, she presents them to the legendary -- and legendarily temperamental -- Rivera (Alfred Molina), who takes her under his wing as an artist, a political revolutionary, and, inevitably, a lover. But their relationship is fraught with trouble, as the philandering Rivera traverses the globe painting murals, and Kahlo languishes in obscurity, longing to make her mark on her own. Frida was directed by Julie Taymor, whose Broadway production of The Lion King won her international acclaim.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Miramax Films (2002)\nCast: Salma Hayek, Alfred Molina, Geoffrey Rush\nDirector: Julie Taymor\nProducers: Mark Amin, Lindsay Flickinger, Brian Gibson, Mark Gill, Sarah Green, Nancy Hardin, Salma Hayek, Jill Sobel Messick, Margaret Rose Perenchio, Jay Polstein, Ann Ruark, Amy Slotnick, Roberto Sneider, Lizz Speed\nScreenwriters: Hayden Herrera, Clancy Sigal, Diane Lake, Gregory Nava, Anna Thomas\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

Set during the Depression era, the film opens as George and Lennie are running from a woman with a torn dress, who has sent a gang of ruffians to chase the two out of the county. After a long bus ride and a ten-mile walk, George and Lennie arrive at a migrant farm in California's San Joaquin Valley, where they seek work. George dreams of putting together enough money to buy a small piece of land where he and Lennie can build a home; he hopes that in California the two can realize their dream. Unfortunately, the foreman of the ranch, Curley (Casey Siemaszko), enjoys tormenting Lennie, while Curley's frustrated wife (Sherilyn Fenn) entices Lennie with her sexual allure. George warns Lennie to steer clear of Curley's wife, but Lennie follows her to a barn where a tragedy occurs and George and Lennie's dreams are shattered.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 MGM (1992)\nCast: Joe D'Angerio, John Malkovich, Tuck Milligan, Richard Riehle, Casey Siemaszko, Gary Sinise, David Steen, John Terry, Ray Walston\nDirector: Gary Sinise\nProducers: Alan C.

In the first scene, a young boy named Michael sits in a wheelchair wearing a red shirt and watches an adult ring a bell while she sings to him.  \n(00:11) In this next scene, Megan and her intervener sit facing each other and play with a green plastic tube.  When the tube is pulled, it expands and makes a popping sound, causing them both to laugh.  \n(00:22) Next, we'll watch Max who is seated at a table. In front of him is a yellow plastic toy, about the size and shape of a large saucepan. Inside the plastic pan are colorful plastic flowers that are connected with yellow tubes that look like stems. Behind Max an adult sits on a stool leaning over him with her arms placed loosely around him. Her hands are on the rim of the plastic pan while his hands explore the toy.  \n(00:31) Now Max is shown sitting in his wheelchair in what appears to be a kitchen. An intervener sits across from him and gently tugs on a white washcloth that he holds with his teeth and both hands.  \n(00:46) Here we'll see Max sitting in his wheelchair in the entryway of a school greeting his intervener.  \n(00:55) Next we will revisit Michael, the child from the beginning of the montage. It is a continuation of the same scene where a bell is being shaken by the adult working with him. When she stops shaking the bell, Michael vocalizes in what sounds like singing, which she then repeats.  \n(01:09) In this scene, Autumn, a teenager, interacts with her intervener outside. They are both wearing heavy coats.  Autumn is also wearing a backpack and they appear to be standing near construction. Behind them we see a grassy green field, a single-story brick school building, and a pasture that is filled with trees. They are facing each other, but quickly turn and begin to walk side-by-side.  As they walk they chatter, repeating each other\u2019s noise and touching each other\u2019s face.  \n(01:23) The next clip is of Lauren, a young child, who is sitting in her mother's lap at a table.  Her mom leans over and sounds out the word \"Mom\" while her lips are close to Lauren\u2019s forehead. Lauren giggles in response, pulls away, and leans in for more. At the end of the scene she softly vocalizes \"Mom\" three times. \n(02:01) Finally, we have Ray, a young boy, who is sitting across from an adult male. In the adult\u2019s lap is a metal baking sheet. As he pulls the sheet up to his chest, the adult leans forward and beats it like a drum. Ray smiles and pushes the metal sheet pan back into his intervener\u2019s lap.\n(02:13) The closing scene is the back of a purple folder which reads: \u201cThanks to all the deafblind students and their interveners!\u201d", "I82ffq4niLU": "Transcript of Description\n\n(00:00) This video is a montage of clips of children working with adults.

Each time she says \"mom,\" the child leans forward nodding her head. \n(00:06) Next, a child sits at a table playing with a toy. Behind him, an adult sits holding her arms loosely around him. As he explores the toy, he excitedly shakes his hands. In response, the adult begins to shake with him. \n(00:13) Now we see a young boy who is sitting across from an adult male. In the adult\u2019s lap is a metal baking sheet.  As the adult drums on the sheet, the child leans forward bringing his head closer to the metal sheet pan and places his hands on the adult\u2019s hands.  In response, the adult begins to drum again. \n(00:17) In this last scene, we observe a teenager interacting with her intervener outside. They are both wearing heavy coats.

Take, for example, her creepy, but incredibly athletic spider crickets.\n\nJohns Hopkins engineering students and their professor have spent more than eight months unraveling the hopping skills, airborne antics and safe-landing patterns of these pesky insects that commonly lurk in the dark corners of damp basements.\n \nThe team, which hopes to pave the way for a new generation of small but skillful jumping robots, will present its findings Nov. 23 during a poster session in Boston at the 68th annual meeting of the American Physical Society\u2019s Division of Fluid Dynamics.\n \nCaption: Undergraduate researcher Emily Palmer and one of her spider cricket subjects. (Credit: Will Kirk/Johns Hopkins University)\n \nThe Johns Hopkins team members believe non-human creatures may be the best models in designing mechanical helpers to carry out certain important tasks. Figuring out how critters move, they say, could lead to planetary rovers that crawl like caterpillars or winged drones that hover like hummingbirds.\n \nSo what design tips did the researchers manage to glean from these spindly six-legged bugs?\n \nFor one thing, the Johns Hopkins researchers were able to use high-speed video cameras to collect tantalizing clues about how these tiny wingless creatures can somehow leap a distance equal to about 60 times their body length. That\u2019s a feat far beyond what any human track star could accomplish. An adult human who wanted to replicate the cricket\u2019s leap would have to jump 300 feet or more\u2014roughly the length of a football field. And, most times, spider crickets manage to land safely on their feet. How, the researchers wanted to know, can these tiny bugs accomplish this?\n\n\u201cBecause they don\u2019t have wings, the main things they use during their \u2018flight\u2019 to stabilize their posture is their limbs,\u201d said Emily Palmer, a sophomore mechanical engineering major in the university\u2019s Whiting School of Engineering who is doing much of the testing. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the way the spider crickets move their bodies and move their limbs to stabilize their posture during a jump.\u201d\n\nTranscript:\n(music)Blue Danube Waltz    \nWatching these animals in slow motion is exactly like watching an elegant ballet happening in front of you.\nThe way they control their flight in the air is very much like a ballerina would do.\nThey really are masters of aerodynamics. \nMy name is Rajat MIttal.\nI'm a professor of mechanical engineering at Johns Hopkins University.\nI want to understand the engineering aspects of these creatures and how they're able to do what they're able to do.\nSo we're studying spider crickets. \nThey don't actually have wings like most field crickets would.\nSo we're looking at the way they move their body and move their legs to stabilize their posture during a jump up to 75 or 80 times their body length. \nWe set the cameras up to take a ten second long video.\nWe're able to capture them in slow motion very accurately.\nFrom there we pull it into a motion tracking software.\nAnd using this program we get to recreate the jump in three dimensions. \nThis 3D model basically allows us to determine the different forces acting upon the cricket.\nWhat we found that we didn't expect was that on the first part of the flight they actually streamline themselves to maximize the distance that they are going to travel. \nBut once they reach the apex of their trajectory they immediately transition to kind of a stabilization posture. \nNow the next thing is to land nicely.\nUltimately the application would be in really tiny robots jumping robots over uneven terrain.\n(rumble)\nYou can imagine a situation where there's an earthquake and we want to send in an army of micro-robots to search for injured people\nand you can imagine how complicated that environment would be.\nA small micro-robot inspired by these insects could potentially navigate this kind of terrain in a much more effective manner.\n(music)\nIt's only when you slow these critters down that you really start to see the beauty and the intricacy of the way they move.\nIt's kind of beautiful in a really weird way that you wouldn't really expect.\n\nVideo by:\nJHU Office of Communications\nvideo@jhu.edu\nPhotographer: Dave Schmelick\nDirector of Video Strategy/Producer/Editor: Len Turner", "xQZFWA2KDbw": null, "2FsdWG_RlvA": "The US could be India's \"best partner\", President Obama said, addressing 2,000 people in Delhi before flying out.\n\nWatch more videos: http://www.ndtv.com/video?yt", "O_yVo3YOfqQ": "Watch this saddest story 3D animation from MMU, Malaysia.

Arguably one of Jim Henson\u2019s most famous Muppet creations, Kermit the Frog has come a long way from his home, the swamp, to become one of the world\u2019s most recognized pop culture icons. From his hit singles \u201cRainbow Connection\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Not Easy Being Green,\u201d hosting  \u201cThe Muppet Show,\u201d  to guest appearances on \u201cSesame Street,\u201d Kermit continues to take on the entertainment business. One leap at a time.\n\nMiss Piggy is the ultimate diva, leading lady, fashion icon, star of stage, screen, and all media known and unknown in perpetuity throughout the universe. Miss Piggy has an appetite for the good things in life, including chocolate, jewelry, awards, and above all, her one true love, Kermit the Frog.\n\nFozzie Bear is the world\u2019s funniest\u2014and only\u2014 stand-up comedy bear. From his beat-up hat to the \u201cwocka wocka\u201d that punctuates his punchlines, Fozzie is an \u201cold school\u201d comic. His jokes aren\u2019t always great, but they are delivered with heart and Fozzie\u2019s signature pazazz. \n\nGonzo is a multi-talented artist who performs outrageous daredevil stunts. Though an odd looking creature, Gonzo takes pride in his uniqueness and enjoys every adventure he goes on with the Muppets including the occasional space voyage. \n\nWalter, the ultimate Muppet fan, has dreamed of being a part of the Muppets since he was literally no bigger than a ball of lint. Being the new kid within the Muppets Walter can be somewhat nervous, soft spoken and shy. But, when the need arises, Walter  is also smart and courageous.\n\nThe Muppets (2011)\nThe Muppets (2011) is the first theatrical release from the Muppets franchise in over a decade, and was brought to the screen by the writing genius of Jason Segel. With Segel, Kermit the frog, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, and friends are back in full force! In \u201cThe Muppets\u201d movie, the Muppets\u2019 biggest fan Walter, a puppet, his brother Gary (Jason Segel), and his brother\u2019s girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) join forces with Kermit the Frog to reunite the Muppets and save the Muppet Theater from being demolished by Tex Richman, who plans to drill for oil in the spot at which the Muppet Theater is built. \n\nWatch the Muppets\u2019 official YouTube channel for behind the scenes videos, clips from \u201cThe Muppets,\u201d and the official trailer for \u201cThe Muppets\u201d.\n\nThe Muppets on YouTube\nWelcome to the Official YouTube channel for The Muppets!

Even though doctors told him walking would never happen, Arthur was persistent. He fell many times, but kept going.\n\nArthur was getting stronger rapidly, and he was losing weight at an incredible rate! Because of DDP's specialized workout, he gained tremendous balance and flexibility -- which gave him hope that maybe someday, he'd be able to walk again.\n\nHis story is proof, that we cannot place limits on what we are capable of doing, because we often do not know our own potential. Niether Arthur, nor Dallas knew what he would go on to accomplish, but this video speaks for itself. In less than a year, Arthur completely transformed his life. If only he had known what he was capable of, 15 years earlier.\n\nDo not waste any time thinking you are stuck - you can take control over your life, and change it faster than you might think. \n\nHopefully this story can inspire you to follow your dreams - whatever they may be.\nAnything is Possible!\n\nFor more information about DDP YOGA, visit http://bit.ly/Kqewdp\n\nArtist Name: Javier

Made without pudding mixes or special ingredients. For me, this is the perfect chocolate chip cookie! Give these a shot because you won't be disappointed!\n\n***PLEASE keep in mind these directions must be followed exactly for the cookies to turn out correctly! If any step is changed, it changes the final outcome of the cookie!*** \n\nWhat you'll need:\n7 Tbsp frozen unsalted butter (do not use margarine!)\n2/3 cup white sugar\n2 Tbsp light brown sugar\n1 large egg\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n1-1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n1/2 tsp baking soda\n1/2 tsp salt\n2 (4.4oz) Hershey's chocolate bars (1 milk chocolate and 1 Special Dark chocolate)\n\nUsing only 3/4 of each chocolate bar, chop into 1/4\" pieces. Put into a bowl and set aside. There should be approximately 1 cups of chocolate chunks. You can also use chips as well but the cookies are not as good with chips. If you do use chips, use 1 cup.\n\nPut frozen butter into a bowl and microwave for about 1 minute or until butter is just slightly melted. Add to the bowl of a stand mixer or another large bowl. Beat until melted butter is incorporated back into the solid (now softened) butter. *Not doing this step this way and using room temp softened butter changes the texture of the cookie.*\n\nAdd in sugars and beat for 1-2 minutes or until the sugars are mostly dissolved into the butter. Scrape down the beater and sides of the bowl and add the egg and vanilla extract. Beat on medium JUST until the egg and vanilla are incorporated. *Over beating changes the final texture of the cookie.*\n\nScrape down the beater and sides of the bowl and using a wooden spoon, stir in the flour, soda and salt. Mix just until flour is incorporated. Stir in the chocolate pieces. Cover the dough and refrigerate until well chilled. *Not chilling the dough makes the cookies turn out differently!*\n\nPreheat oven to 325*F. Grab a spoonful of the dough and gently roll into a ball about the size of a golf ball. Flatten slightly and put onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Place cookies about 4\" apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the cookies are just BARELY lightly browned around the edges. Watch them closely! Under baking is better than over baking here!  When done, let sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before removing to a cutting board or your counter to cool completely. Let cookie sheet come back to room temperature before making more cookies. \n\nRecipe yields about 10 4\" cookies.

Only 800 people around the world suffer from this, the majority of whom are innocent children who were born with this horrible genetic condition.\n\n17 YEAR OLD FILM-MAKER RELEASES CAPTIVATING SHORT FILM TO BUILD AWARENESS OF RARE FATAL GENETIC DISEASE\n\nFirst, Carl Mason learnt that his nine year old neighbour suffers from Niemann Pick Type C, then he raised \u00a36000 to produce a full-scale short film to help increase awareness of the extremely rare disease. The young film-maker secured collaborative support from over 20 television and film professionals to create a film that could aid fundraising efforts and also raise medical awareness of NP-C.\n\nThe screenplay was written by John F. McDonald, a multi-award winning screenwriter, with the careful guidance of NP-C charity Hope for Hollie, Niemann Pick UK, INPDA and Great Ormond Street Hospital. What is also particularly impressive is that this teenager secured a production team including camera,  audio, editing, costume and make-up professionals who all work full-time in the film industry with diverse experience ranging from ITV's Broadchurch, Doctor Who, Shaun Of The Dead, Hot Fuzz, Channel 4 Drama, BBC Worldwide and more. Carl said \u201cWorking with such a seasoned team has made my directing d\u00e9but particularly special. I very much hope that the film will inspire donations to the charities involved and increase awareness of this horrible disease within both the medical profession and public alike.  Obviously it has been an extremely enjoyable project to work on, but the fact is, this is a fatal disease that barely anyone has ever heard of and I wanted to change that.\u201d\n\nFor further information and photos please contact Rachael Dines, PR Consultant for IMAGINE on 07787 127624 or hello@marketing-professional.co.uk\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ImagineNPC\nhttps://twitter.com/ImagineShort\n\nCAST:\nMaisy Nixon\nClaire Whitelock\nDan Burman\nTim Dalgleish\nHolly Hall\nAna Diego\n\nCREW:\nDirector & Producer: Carl Mason\nScreenplay: John F.

Tie the Windsor knot, step by step, in 2 minutes. This \"tie tutorial\" will have you looking sharp and confident in no time at all! How to tie a tie mirrored slowly. \n\nwindsor knot, windsor knot tie, windsor knot steps, windsor knot half, windsor knot video, windsor knot instructions, windsor knot diagram, windsor knot vs half windsor, how to tie a tie, double windsor, full windsor, how to, necktie (garment), how to tie a necktie, half windsor.\n\nHello. I'm Charles from Louis Purple, and today I'm going to teach you how to tie a Windsor knot. The Windsor knot is actually a very simple knot to tie, and it's very useful because it projects confidence. So it's a wide, triangular knot that's very suitable for presentations, job interviews, or cultural appearances, which I hope you don't frequent too often. So this is how you start. \n\nYou just find the right balance depending on the length of your tie, with the wide end on the right hand side and the narrow end on the left. You might want to adjust exactly where the center of the tie should be at in the middle of your neck. So this is how you start. You cross over the wide end over the narrow end. You bring the wide end through the loop between the collar and the tie. And you bring the wide end back down. \n\nThen you just pull the wide end underneath, and then bring it up through the loop again in order to have a symmetrical shape, which should look like this. And you're almost done. There's only the easy part left and the most rewarding. Pull the wide end in front. Bring the wide end underneath, and then slide it inside the loop and tie it in the knot. You draw the knot up in order to fit your collar. So it's a knot that's really suitable for widespread collars. And as I said, then you can just adjust and tighten how big of a knot you like to obtain. This is how you tie a Windsor knot.", "w4b9uKZNCIU": null, "2y1QQWNZxZM": "Visual Video Description: \n(0:0) A toddler boy and his father are in a living room.

Fantastic music and a great kitschy musical number. Apparently this is the best scene in the entire 1965 film, \"Gumnaan\". Everyone wants to know is the band really, 'Ted Lyons and His Cubs.' as it says on the drums Somehow I think not, but its a great name! The singer on the track is apparently Mohammed Rafi. \nI think the 'bad' choreography is genius (or is that a non-sequitur?) Finally found out a great deal about Gumnaan here:\nhttp://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/g/gumnaam.html\n\nUsing this \"movie within a movie\" was a brilliant way to open Ghostworld, intercutting this song and musical number with short glimpses into people's lives as the camera pans past  windows of houses before coming rest in the room of one of his main characters, played by Thora Birch. Enjoy and rent Ghostworld if you've never seen it: Its a well directed great indie film with 3 terrific performances from Thora Birch, Steve Buscemi, and a young and still very natural Scarlett Johansson.\n\nNEWSFLASH: God bless YouTube - and basebase5!\nFound the ENTIRE ORIGINAL CLIP here: its even better than I thought; Ck it out!!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgeuUAzThto&feature=related\n\n\n(All rights are of the original owners; short clip for educational and/or artistic commentary under FAIR USE)", "-RtZZZmmdgU": "The gorgeous Oscar-nominated actress and the \"This Is Us\" hunk joined Ellen for a fun new game to raise money for a wonderful cause.", "AWjBNSshF3s": "6 Amazing Cooking Hacks For Your Home Kitchen!\nsee my other tricks videos here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af3dEbAd4Os & here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hnFxU88NWI  \n\nList of Tricks in this video: \n\n1- Rainbow Colored Pasta\n2- Ice Cream Cookies\n3- Egg Bottle Hack\n4- Egg Cooking Trick\n5- Yogurt Ice Cream\n6- Egg Heart Hack\n\nfood colours used in the video: http://amzn.to/22Givc8  \n\n----------------------------------------------- \n\nAll Recipe Videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/MakeSushi1/videos   \nThis YouTube Food channel is all about making sushi recipes and trying to teach great food recipes.\n\n\nWhat to support this channel? you can do the following:\n1) Share this video on Facebook or Twitter\n2) Show your support on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/makesushi1 \n3) Add my channel to your featured channel box \"makesushi1\"\n4) Embed this video on a blog \n*Thank you for your support*\n\n*SOCIAL MEDIA :*\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MakeSushi1   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/makesushi1   \nInstagram:  @MakeSushi1 or use the hashtag #makesushi1 \n\ncameras used to film this:\n2x Canon 5D m3: http://amzn.to/1iiSP3o  \nsometimes a GoPro Hero4: http://amzn.to/1WeCBqK  \n\nProduced by http://www.makesushi.com   Chef: Davy Devaux \n\nlink to this video for sharing: https://youtu.be/AWjBNSshF3s  \nlast week's video: https://youtu.be/YUjksFH77dc  \n\nI use affiliate links to share products I like, find useful, and feel that readers will find helpful.

Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is having a rough time lately: she's still getting over the brutal rape and murder of her mother a year ago, and now one of her friends (Drew Barrymore) has been killed by a lunatic who harassed her with terrifying phone calls, then stabbed her to death while wearing a Halloween costume. Soon Sydney is receiving similar phone calls, quizzing her on the arcane details of such films as Friday the 13th and Prom Night, and is attacked by the same cloaked maniac. With her father missing, she has hardly anyone on her side except her best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) and Tatum's brother Dewey (David Arquette), a half-bright cop. As for the murderer, it could be any number of people: Syd's father; her cute but overly intense boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ullrich); Tatum's goofball boyfriend Stuart (Matthew Lillard); or Randy (Jamie Kennedy), who works at the local video store and seems to like horror movies just a little too much. Much like Halloween, Scream spawned a series of sequels and inspired a large number of similar films -- its original working title, Scary Movie, became the title of the 2000 parody film by Damon Wayans.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Miramax Films (1996)\nCast: Drew Barrymore\nDirector: Wes Craven\nProducers: Stuart M.

Dutton) reveals that years back, he also quit the team and has regretted it ever since.\n\nFILM DESCRIPTION:\nA young man learns to let nothing stop him from realizing his ambitions in this drama, based on a true story. Ever since he was a little boy, Rudy Ruettiger (Sean Astin) has dreamed of attending Notre Dame University, and playing on the Fighting Irish football team. However, Rudy's dream doesn't seem very practical; Daniel (Ned Beatty), his father, works in a steel mill and can ill afford to send his son to Notre Dame, while Rudy's grades are not especially impressive, and standing a shade over five feet tall and weighing a little over 100 pounds, Rudy is hardly built for the gridiron. However, with the help of Father Cavanaugh (Robert Prosky), a sympathetic priest, Rudy is admitted to nearby Holy Cross, and in his junior year manages to squeak into Notre Dame as a transfer student. Rudy works as an assistant to the football stadium's groundskeeper, Fortune (Charles S. Dutton), to pay his tuition (often sleeping in Fortune's office since he can't afford a room), studies diligently, and appears at tryouts for the football team. Rudy is made a member of the practice team, which means he's little more than a human tackling dummy, but Coach Ara Parseghian (Jason Miller) is impressed with Rudy's devotion and determination, and pledges that he'll allow him to dress for one game before he graduates, so his name can be recorded as an official member of the team. However, the arrival of a new coach and a tough season that allows for few unnecessary players may put a stop to Rudy's dreams within sight of the finish line. Rudy also stars Jon Favreau, Lili Taylor, and Scott Benjaminson.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Sony (1993)\nCast: Sean Astin, Charles S. Dutton\nDirector: David Anspaugh\nProducers: Robert N.

Set during the Depression era, the film opens as George and Lennie are running from a woman with a torn dress, who has sent a gang of ruffians to chase the two out of the county. After a long bus ride and a ten-mile walk, George and Lennie arrive at a migrant farm in California's San Joaquin Valley, where they seek work. George dreams of putting together enough money to buy a small piece of land where he and Lennie can build a home; he hopes that in California the two can realize their dream. Unfortunately, the foreman of the ranch, Curley (Casey Siemaszko), enjoys tormenting Lennie, while Curley's frustrated wife (Sherilyn Fenn) entices Lennie with her sexual allure. George warns Lennie to steer clear of Curley's wife, but Lennie follows her to a barn where a tragedy occurs and George and Lennie's dreams are shattered.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 MGM (1992)\nCast: John Malkovich, Gary Sinise\nDirector: Gary Sinise\nProducers: Alan C.

Directed by Spielberg, Disney\u2019s \u201cThe BFG\u201d tells the imaginative story of a young girl and the Giant who introduces her to the wonders and perils of Giant Country. The BFG (Mark Rylance), while a giant himself, is a Big Friendly Giant and nothing like the other inhabitants of Giant Country. Standing 24-feet tall with enormous ears and a keen sense of smell, he is endearingly dim-witted and keeps to himself for the most part. Giants like Bloodbottler (Bill Hader) and Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) on the other hand, are twice as big and at least twice as scary and have been known to eat humans, while the BFG prefers Snozzcumber and Frobscottle. Upon her arrival in Giant Country, Sophie, a precocious 10-year-old girl from London, is initially frightened of the mysterious giant who has brought her to his cave, but soon comes to realize that the BFG is actually quite gentle and charming, and, having never met a giant before, has many questions. The BFG brings Sophie to Dream Country where he collects dreams and sends them to children, teaching her all about the magic and mystery of dreams. Having both been on their own in the world up until now, their affection for one another quickly grows, but Sophie\u2019s presence in Giant Country has attracted the unwanted attention of the other giants, who have become increasingly more bothersome. Sophie and the BFG soon depart for London to see the Queen (Penelope Wilton) and warn her of the precarious giant situation, but they must first convince the Queen and her maid, Mary (Rebecca Hall), that giants do indeed exist. Together, they come up with a plan to get rid of the giants once and for all. \n\nLike Disney's The BFG on Facebook:\nwww.facebook.com/thebfgmovie\n\nFollow Disney's The BFG on Twitter:\nwww.twitter.com/disneystudios", "o765gV3pyVM": null, "vHmswhPvus4": null, "-PN1gwDOa5I": "\u201cWitness the incredible power that music has to connect with people on the autism spectrum\u201d - Ali Ewoldt, Christine in Phantom of the Opera. \n\nNOTE: Autism Theatre Initiative was the original name for Autism Friendly Performances\n\nHear more about her experience performing in our autism-friendly performance and donate now: donate.tdf.org\n\nTDF is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to bringing the power of the performing arts to everyone.", "SNTcxD_xPfk": "\"Accessible theatre is important because it is EVERYONE\u2019S right to see theatre.\u201d - Catherine Brunell, Something Rotten The Musical\nThese students are so grateful for the experiences that you make happen. \n\nGive the gift of theatre today! http://access.tdf.org\n\nTDF is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to bringing the power of the performing arts to everyone.", "ozO_1RARiyU": null, "V9p3cuKEy4o": "Set up Special Access in D2L Assignments and Quizzes.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\n00:22 - Assignments\n02:50 - Quizzes\n06:06 - Summary\n06:26 - Any questions?\n\nA version of the video with audio description of visual elements can be found at http://youdescribe.org/player.php?v=V9p3cuKEy4o&prefer_d=srjudd\n\nThe summarized steps for special access listed on the penultimate slide are\nIn both Assignments and Quizzes:\nEdit the tool item.\nGo to the \u201cRestrictions\u201d tab.\nChoose to add special access.\nAdjust settings for a specific student or students on a special access screen.\nSave your way out.\n\nThe link to the NLU Library and Learning Support web page for accommodations is http://www.nl.edu/librarylearningsupport/adaaccommodations/", "TDvBqq3v8bM": null, "DR8W_O_TRAk": null, "6sI2w91iQXQ": "Internship Experience\nMontclair State University\n\nIncludes: peer leader and student interviews, overview of my experience as an intern with the MSU Orientation Program", "okhav661S9Q": null, "F_UUjLu6mI0": "Are good sides real?

You would be right, of course, but that definition doesn't mean anything unless you have some knowledge of what calculus is. Let's keep it simple, shall we? Calculus is a conceptual framework which provides systematic techniques for solving problems. These problems are appropriately applicable to analytic geometry and algebra. Therefore....precalculus gives you the background for the mathematical concepts, problems, issues and techniques that appear in calculus, including trigonometry, functions, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, and others. There you have it ladies and gentlemen....an introduction to precalculus!\n\nAbout Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.\n\nFor free. For everyone.

Cain novel by Wilder and Raymond Chandler, Double Indemnity represents the high-water mark of 1940s film noir urban crime dramas in which a greedy, weak man is seduced and trapped by a cold, evil woman amidst the dark shadows and Expressionist lighting of modern cities. Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) seduces insurance agent Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) into murdering her husband to collect his accident policy. The murder goes as planned, but after the couple's passion cools, each becomes suspicious of the other's motives. The plan is further complicated when Neff's boss Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), a brilliant insurance investigator, takes over the investigation. Told in flashbacks from Neff's perspective, the film moves with ruthless determinism as each character meets what seems to be a preordained fate. Movie veterans Stanwyck, MacMurray, and Robinson give some of their best performances, and Wilder's cynical sensibility finds a perfect match in the story's unsentimental perspective, heightened by John Seitz's hard-edged cinematography. Double Indemnity ranks with the classics of mainstream Hollywood movie-making.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Universal (1944)\nCast: Barbara Stanwyck\nDirector: Billy Wilder\nProducers: Buddy G.

The \"Thriller\" single reached No. 1 in four countries in 1984, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart as well as charts in Spain, France and Belgium. The song peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, making Thriller the first album to feature seven Top 10 singles. The Recording Industry Association of America certified \"Thriller\" Gold and Platinum on December 4, 1989. \n\nThe groundbreaking short films for the Thriller album, starting with \"Billie Jean,\" following up with \"Beat It\" and culminating with the epic, nearly 14-minute \"Thriller,\" truly expanded the possibilities of \"music video\" as art form. \"I wanted something that would glue you to the set, something you'd want to watch over and over,\" Michael wrote in his 1988 memoir Moonwalk. \"I wanted to be a pioneer in this relatively new medium and make the best short music movies we could make.\"\n\nIn the short film's extended prologue, Michael's moonlit date with his girlfriend (played by model Ola Ray) is interrupted by his sudden transformation into a howling werewolf. While the \"real\" Michael and Ola, observing the scene in a movie theater, walk home from the their date, Michael teases her by singing the verses of \"Thriller.\"\n\nSubscribe to the official Michael Jackson YouTube channel: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/subscribeYD\n\nFollow Michael Jackson:\nFacebook: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/followFI\nTwitter: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/followTI\nInstagram: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/followII\nWebsite: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/followWI\nSpotify: https://MichaelJackson.lnk.to/followSI\n\nLyrics:\nIt's close to midnight\nSomething evil's lurking from the dark\nUnder the moonlight\nYou see a sight that almost stops your heart\nYou try to scream\nBut terror takes the sound before you make it\nYou start to freeze\nAs horror looks you right between your eyes\nYou're paralyzed\n'Cause this is thriller\nThriller night\nAnd no one's gonna save you\nFrom the beast about to strike\nYou know it's thriller\nThriller night\nYou're fighting for your life\nInside a killer thriller tonight, yeah\n\n#MichaelJackson #Thriller #Halloween #4kRemastered", "dkjbMoj0JY4": null, "Gv1aDEFlXq8": null, "oCLTRjF2eq0": "\"I'm a fool to help that horrible old man!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you learned your lesson Lisa, never help anyone.\"", "tEyDRWmQEKs": null, "NbqHZiap_u4": "Squiggy's famous entrance on \"Laverne & Shirley.\" This clip taken from \"A Nun's Story, season 1, episode 4.", "bYw1gRtyGiw": "Ebola!

Geological sampling on this frozen continent provides insight into climate changes over the past million years, allowing scientists to study global warming in a historical context. \n\nRussia has been at the forefront of Antarctic exploration for almost two centuries. Since the First Russian Antarctic Expedition in 1820, led by F. F. Bellingshausen and M.P. Lazarev, its scientists have made significant contributions to the investigation and especially the mapping of Antarctica. From that time on, extensive research has been carried out, first by several Soviet and then Russian institutions, and the country now maintains five permanent southern polar stations.\n\nThe trouble is that, despite advances in modern transport, the only reliable means of reaching the world\u2019s southernmost continent is by sea. The diesel-electric scientific research vessel, \u201cAcademic Fyodorov\u201d was almost made for the job and this time, Russia\u2019s polar research fleet flagship is on a mission to visit two year-round Antarctic stations, \u201cProgress\u201d and \u201cNovolazarevskaya\u201d.\n\n\u201cFyodorov\u201d, the only scientific ship able to reach Antarctica without an ice-breaker convoy, has been through thick and thin over the years and so has its crew! The most established member is 86-year-old, Arnold Budretsky, a polar exploration pioneer. There was nothing but ice and stone before he and his fellow explorers first landed on that frozen desert. Arnold himself has taken charge of opening 10 Antarctic stations, and has an impressive reserve of knowledge and experience to pass on to the next generation of explorers. \n\nAntarctica is notorious for its unpredictable weather and harsh climate and at sea, the explorers have only themselves to rely on, there are no other vessels for hundreds of miles and nothing but icebergs for company. Just getting to Antarctica takes 6 months, a challenge on its own. \n\nThere is much for newcomers to learn before settling in as a real part of this small crew: managing food storage for example, and a curious way to keep eggs fresh! People from all walks of life are eager to embark on this voyage to experience the difficulties that research station life entails, which include 24-hour shifts. \n\nThe hardship makes Antarctica the ultimate survival test. For many though, the severe but beautiful environment becomes almost addictive, so much so that for many, it feels like home.\n\nThe diesel-electric ice ship Akademik Fyodorov travels to Antarctica, where two of Russia's research stations will receive enough supplies to last them until next summer as winter quickly approaches.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO RTD Channel to get documentaries firsthand! http://bit.ly/1MgFbVy\n\nFOLLOW US\nRTD WEBSITE: https://RTD.rt.com/\nRTD ON TWITTER: http://twitter.com/RT_DOC\nRTD ON FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/RTDocumentary\nRTD ON DAILYMOTION http://www.dailymotion.com/rt_doc\nRTD ON INSTAGRAM http://instagram.com/rt_documentary/\nRTD LIVE https://rtd.rt.com/on-air/", "QYZLy5uC5uc": ".\nMARCEL IS NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE! \nWATCH IT HERE:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Marcel_the_Shell_with_Shoes_On?id=X84jvv_Hdkc.P\n\nDirected + Animated by Dean Fleischer Camp\nWritten by Dean Fleischer Camp +Jenny Slate \nStarring Jenny Slate\nFollow us on tiktok @marceltheshellwshoeson\ntwitter @DFLEISCHERCAMP\nig @DeanFleischerCamp", "cMV_gvBwL1g": "Guilford College vs Randolph Macon \nJanuary 31, 2005\n\nTo set this up:\nThe teams are tied with just a fraction of a second in overtime.\n\nThe yellow team (Randolph Macon) sinks a free throw to win the game.

Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest amidst a remarkable array of historical events and people.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Paramount (1994)\nCast: Tom Hanks, Michael Conner Humphreys, Hanna Hall\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\nProducers: Wendy Finerman, Charles Newirth, Steve Starkey, Steve Tisch\nScreenwriters: Winston Groom, Eric Roth\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

Jeffries (James Stewart) is confined to his tiny, sweltering courtyard apartment. To pass the time between visits from his nurse (Thelma Ritter) and his fashion model girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), the binocular-wielding Jeffries stares through the rear window of his apartment at the goings-on in the other apartments around his courtyard. As he watches his neighbors, he assigns them such roles and character names as \"Miss Torso\" (Georgine Darcy), a professional dancer with a healthy social life or \"Miss Lonelyhearts\" (Judith Evelyn), a middle-aged woman who entertains nonexistent gentlemen callers. Of particular interest is seemingly mild-mannered travelling salesman Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), who is saddled with a nagging, invalid wife. One afternoon, Thorwald pulls down his window shade, and his wife's incessant bray comes to a sudden halt. Out of boredom, Jeffries casually concocts a scenario in which Thorwald has murdered his wife and disposed of the body in gruesome fashion. Trouble is, Jeffries' musings just might happen to be the truth. One of Alfred Hitchcock's very best efforts, Rear Window is a crackling suspense film that also ranks with Michael Powell's Peeping Tom (1960) as one of the movies' most trenchant dissections of voyeurism. As in most Hitchcock films, the protagonist is a seemingly ordinary man who gets himself in trouble for his secret desires.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Universal (1954)\nCast: Raymond Burr, James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter\nDirector: Alfred Hitchcock\nProducers: James C.

To that end  we develop technology solutions that fill the gaps in access to digital content for students with print disabilities such as visual impairment. Math in ebooks presents a particular problem for students because math is often rendered as a picture for display purposes. When a screenreader comes across it, the student hears \u201cimage\u201d with no means to access the content behind the image. To help solve this problem, Benetech, in partnership with Microsoft, the American Mathematical Society, and the developers behind Google\u2019s ChromeVox, have developed MathML Cloud. Math ML Cloud takes an encoded mathematical equation and automatically generates a formatted image and the plain English description of the equation that can be spoken by a screen reader.  Watch how quick and easy this is. In seconds, Math ML generates both the alt text and the rendered image using just the text as input. Publishers get both the display they need and the alt text students will need to read the book. MathML Cloud is open source, which means that it is free and easy for publishers to build into their existing workflows. And, because MathML Cloud automatically stores the original math equation in the cloud, the information can always be accessed again as new technologies and tools emerge. MathML Cloud is but one of many exciting initiatives under Benetech\u2019s Global Literacy umbrella.

Hayek ages some 30 years onscreen as she charts Frida Kahlo's life from feisty schoolgirl to Diego Rivera prot\u00e9g\u00e9e to world-renowned artist in her own right. Frida details Kahlo's affluent upbringing in Mexico City, and her nurturing relationship with her traditional mother (Patricia Reyes Spindola) and philosophical father (Roger Rees). Having already suffered the crippling effects of polio, Kahlo sustains further injuries when a city bus accident nearly ends her life. But in her bed-ridden state, the young artist produces dozens upon dozens of pieces; when she recovers, she presents them to the legendary -- and legendarily temperamental -- Rivera (Alfred Molina), who takes her under his wing as an artist, a political revolutionary, and, inevitably, a lover. But their relationship is fraught with trouble, as the philandering Rivera traverses the globe painting murals, and Kahlo languishes in obscurity, longing to make her mark on her own. Frida was directed by Julie Taymor, whose Broadway production of The Lion King won her international acclaim.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Miramax Films (2002)\nCast: Salma Hayek, Alfred Molina, Roberto Medina\nDirector: Julie Taymor\nProducers: Mark Amin, Lindsay Flickinger, Brian Gibson, Mark Gill, Sarah Green, Nancy Hardin, Salma Hayek, Jill Sobel Messick, Margaret Rose Perenchio, Jay Polstein, Ann Ruark, Amy Slotnick, Roberto Sneider, Lizz Speed\nScreenwriters: Hayden Herrera, Clancy Sigal, Diane Lake, Gregory Nava, Anna Thomas\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

This mid-air haptic feedback eliminates the need for any attachment of actuators or contact with physical devices.

For many people, this can be an intimidating moment. Between the sheer noise of power tools, their safety implications, and even just knowing what a particular tool is capable of, it can hard to know where to start. If you\u2019re looking for an entry point to designing and making your own creations, where do you begin? Our solution is Drill Sergeant. \n\nDrill Sergeant is an ecosystem of augmented power tools that will help you develop confidence and hands-on skills with power tools. Tools in this ecosystem are outfitted with sensors that provide realtime feedback, including tips on what to try and how to stay safe. \n\nVia a small digital projector mounted on the tools themselves, feedback from these sensors appears directly on the surface or part you are working on, with additional information and visualizations available on an adjacent tablet display. This immediate, seamlessly integrated feedback allows you to develop mastery while actively using the tool -- bringing together learning and making. \n\nCurrent tools in this ecosystem include an augmented drill and an augmented miter saw, each of which is designed to maximize awareness and precision. Using three calibrated time-of-flight distance sensors, the augmented drill can locate itself relative to a workpiece. \n\nFeatures include realtime drill depth, which provides live guidance as you approach your desired drilling depth, and drill angle assist, which allows you to easily visualize and correct the drill\u2019s orientation to ensure straightness. The augmented miter saw is another powerful tool for new makers. Two linear potentiometers enable a cutting stroke feedback feature, which helps you ensure a smooth and even stroke as you cut through a surface. The augmented saw also offers a precision cut measuring feature, which uses a laser distance finder to help you accurately judge the length of your cut. \n\nAltogether, Drill Sergeant\u2019s components constitute an ecosystem enabling you to create precise, customized projects and assemblies. However, our system goes further by letting you customize an assembly on the fly and by supporting aided error recovery. If you want to change the width of a part or accidentally cut something a little too short, Drill Sergeant can update the dependent measurements and instructions to accommodate. \n\nIf you need to hang a shelf between two walls, Drill Sergeant\u2019s digital measuring tape can automatically update a parametric model, generating plans and displaying step-by-step instructions to you. Throughout the process, Drill Sergeant will hone and reinforce your skills. \n\nAnyone should be able to express themselves and make their own projects. With Drill Sergeant, you can walk into a workshop, regardless of skill, and walk out an expert with a precise, customized artifact. Drill Sergeant paves the way for a more hands-on, innovative future, empowering a diverse new generation of makers to \u201cinnovate by design\u201d as they bring their ideas to life. \n\nDrill Sergeant was designed by Eldon Schoop and Michelle Nguyen, undergraduate and master\u2019s students graduating in Spring 2016 at UC Berkeley.", "8w_S17dZ2Do": "Claire Kearney-Volpe and Chancey Fleet visit the studio to talk about their work with coding and accessibility for low vision and blind people.\n\nYouDescribe version of the video: https://youdescribe.org/video/8w_S17dZ2Do?ad=58e7cf3846e13dfd851a26e0\n\nLinks discussed in the video:\nTeach Access: http://teachaccess.org/\nNVAccess: http://www.nvaccess.org/\nNYU ABILITY Project: http://ability.nyu.edu/\nAppleVis: http://www.applevis.com/\nYouDescribe: http://youdescribe.org/\nSeeing Eye GPS on AppleVis: http://www.applevis.com/apps/ios/navigation/seeing-eye-gps\n\nContact: \nClaire Kearney-Volpe:  claire.kv@nyu.edu\nChancey Fleet: ChanceyFleet@gmail.com\n\nTwitter:\nAbility Project: http://twitter.com/AbilityNYU\nChancey Fleet: http://twitter.com/ChanceyFleet\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/72qC/\n\n\ud83d\udcc4 Code of Conduct: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Code-of-Conduct", "RpJd0HeaPHo": null, "bxBHjpuXvCY": "A video montage with a short series of video clips.\n\n0:00- An elementary school aged light skinned, deaf-blind boy sits on the floor of a classroom on a mat with his teacher, adult light skinned female, who traces the outline of his feet onto paper.\n\n0:05 An adult light skinned female teacher sits with an elementary school aged light skinned female at a table with a Perkins brailler.

Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is having a rough time lately: she's still getting over the brutal rape and murder of her mother a year ago, and now one of her friends (Drew Barrymore) has been killed by a lunatic who harassed her with terrifying phone calls, then stabbed her to death while wearing a Halloween costume. Soon Sydney is receiving similar phone calls, quizzing her on the arcane details of such films as Friday the 13th and Prom Night, and is attacked by the same cloaked maniac. With her father missing, she has hardly anyone on her side except her best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) and Tatum's brother Dewey (David Arquette), a half-bright cop. As for the murderer, it could be any number of people: Syd's father; her cute but overly intense boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ullrich); Tatum's goofball boyfriend Stuart (Matthew Lillard); or Randy (Jamie Kennedy), who works at the local video store and seems to like horror movies just a little too much. Much like Halloween, Scream spawned a series of sequels and inspired a large number of similar films -- its original working title, Scary Movie, became the title of the 2000 parody film by Damon Wayans.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Miramax Films (1996)\nCast: Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, David Arquette\nDirector: Wes Craven\nProducers: Stuart M.

If you follow my career, you know that I often speak about a difficult time in my life when I was depressed and lifeless. This book isn\u2019t the story of my depression, nor is it a story about my recovery. This book isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about a fight. A fight that every single one of us is experiencing, whether it\u2019s against our mind, our health, our relationships, our bank accounts or the society we live in.\n \nSometimes we start to lose those fights and we lose faith that we\u2019ll be able to gain everything we hope for in life; we start to accept defeat and settle for mediocrity. This book is a giant middle finger to those doubts and that voice inside that says \u201cYou can\u2019t do it\u201d.  You won\u2019t find any cute quotes or fairytale messages here, because fluffy clich\u00e9s don\u2019t bring success, there's plenty of that floating around Tumblr already. This book is filled with honest, hard-hitting, practical guidelines and tips that will build you up, call you out when need be, and encourage you to work hard for the success you deserve. \n \n#BawseBook will not teach you how to survive life, because I don\u2019t want you to simply survive. You are not in the middle of the ocean, floating on a door, holding on to Jack and waiting for someone to come and rescue you. You can do more than that.

She is a multimodal artist; a dancer, singer, actress, poet, writer and producer of her own works. She brings athletic agility to her vocal performance by singing and dancing in unison, eliminating the boundary between the visual and audio experience. Her sound is a fusion of Soul, Funk, Jazz, R&B and Pop. Her lyrics mix vulnerability with authenticity that beautifully snaps the listener back to reality.\n\nShe is a former vocal artist, choreographer and co-creative director for Stokley Williams, front man of Mint Condition gone solo. She is also a former dance artist with Camille A. Brown & Dancers, TU Dance and a founding member of The August Wilson Center Dance Ensemble (Top 25 to Watch, Dance Magazine, 2012). She has choreographed and performed with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, The Guthrie Theater with The Moving Company and she has also choreographed for The Children's Theater in Minneapolis, MN. While with The August Wilson Center Dance Ensemble she traveled with The US Embassy to teach and perform in Suriname in South America. Vie was trained at Point Park University's Conservatory of Performing Arts and The Ailey School. Over the course of her career she performed the works of Kyle Abraham, Gregory Dolbashian, Dwight Rhoden, Uri Sands, Darrell Grand Moultrie and Sidra Bell. She is also a soul, funk, jazz vocalist and has opened for international acts Little Dragon, Bilal and J*Davey.\n\n\nJOBSITE\nDirected by Theo Langason \nCinematographer: Serena Violet Hodges \nCamera Operator:  Adam Foster Jacobs\n\nA space in process, process in space. JOBSITE is a video series chronicling the process of Red Eye\u2019s new theater as it is under construction. A diverse collection of artists across multiple disciplines performing in a space unfinished, JOBSITE juxtaposes artistic work with an active construction site. Artistic work is work. Artists build and labor. The stage, rehearsal room, the page, the canvas: these are where the work happens. These are the JOBSITE.  The series is directed and coordinated by Red Eye Co-Artistic Director Theo Langason in collaboration with filmmakers Serena Violet Hodges and Adam Foster Jacobs.\n\nSpecial thanks:\nPeter Morrow\nFlannery Construction\n\nRED EYE\u2019S NEW HOME \nRed Eye Theater is thrilled to be building a new performance space in the Seward neighborhood of South Minneapolis! We have signed a long-term lease on a space in the Focus Arts building at 2213 Snelling Avenue. Focus Arts is run by Seward Redesign, a rad nonprofit community development organization that has fully dedicated this building to local arts organizations. Red Eye will build out our new ~3000 sq ft space into a flexible and fully accessible black box theater, inviting collaboration and artistic experimentation. We envision this space as a home for contemporary performance in the Twin Cities--a place for artists to exchange ideas, build networks of support, grow and deepen their practices over time, and share work with audiences.\n\nSupport Red Eye Theater\nhttps://www.givemn.org/organization/Red-Eye-Theater", "cx89a0TZfcU": null, "efsSfD4EUz4": null, "mAZyOyFNpFY": null, "DFReVJAHEiE": null, "cNzN-6VRFFY": null, "p9nvHYQfLS0": null, "umbFG5WA6pM": null, "jZA2BAMf3VU": null, "eR3BXiOZaDo": null, "gPmbbdr02QU": null, "7bcA_F_0gD8": null, "6dGc1CvKumY": null, "zEHbnLcPv48": null, "BnRQ1-X2C4c": null, "k5sG-iEdfE0": null, "5dBdRxk9iyk": null, "cNhatudF464": null, "2vaBsow53b4": null, "zddoHL8b2nw": null, "XXbSHz6Qjpg": null, "n7Mek_NJO2g": null, "7m8grcH09oE": null, "ibo9ADCcM1c": null, "sYVtTSlwKXw": null, "fGnEOBjjTQQ": null, "egBzKd6Nr8Q": null, "2UqNw1mvTXc": null, "J4vS8la2sQY": null, "1rDb8_uNwbo": null, "xroy2VFphi4": null, "zrbV2p5WpMI": null, "K4ndrsUqw-E": null, "uTpSs3jmZqs": null, "PXvpNtymIaw": null, "h3LeSDOZeQg": null, "w9glWMxcUhI": null, "1glSkXtwq14": null, "E3kkS6sVMew": null, "aPyax5kJaNg": null, "oTBlmBaw46c": null, "2pKosXv66_0": null, "_iMNU7k_jUg": null, "WhihVLZrvRQ": null, "OITWgx8K6Ko": null, "JAAQ2FnnkX8": null, "Cjaz7UsfIkc": "Closed captioning available for this video. \n\nTo experience an audio described version of this episode please visit: \nhttps://youdescribe.org/video/Cjaz7UsfIkc?ad=5f5f760d152f97652a3bdf83\n\nThank You 5! is a Bricolage Production Company interview show designed to engage theatre artists in simple conversations about their craft.
